# WP Admin Customizer

This WordPress plugin gives you the ability to create and edit a custom admin color scheme. It also allows you to change the login logo for WordPress, and disable dashboard widgets.

## Upgrading From 1.0.0

Version 2.0.0 represents a complete rewrite, and a few breaking changes:
* Due to the way WordPress now handles colors in the admin, you will need to reset all of your settings when upgrading.
* The Developer Features (Contact Form) have been removed.
* The Rounded Corners on login screen has been removed.

## Installation

1. Upload the folder to your Wordpress Plugins directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Under "Settings" Look for the "Admin Theme" link.
